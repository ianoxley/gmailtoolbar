GMail Toolbar
=============
This is a simple Greasemonkey script that uses CSS to give the toolbar that appears at the top of GMail fixed positioning. This means that the links to Google Reader, Google Calendar, Google Docs, et al are always at the top of the screen meaning less scrolling up and down for you :)
